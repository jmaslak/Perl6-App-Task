Title: [task] BUG: No confirmation on close without note

If you close a task (task close x), and say "Y" to enter a note, but 
then don't add anything in the note, it will close the task without 
confirmation.

This may be a bit trickier than I frist thought, since the "Save this 
task" confirmation is in the addnote() routine.  It probably should be 
broken out to it's own routine.
