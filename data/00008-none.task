The App::Tasks::Config object should facilitate this.

We should have a language attribute in the config file.  This should use 
a combination of built-in languages and also languages referenced by 
name from the YAML file.

I.E.:

theme: light
language: en-US

or

theme: light
language: en-UK
languages:
 en-uk:
  ... Configuration here ...
