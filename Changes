0.0.8  2018-10-18T21:20:43-06:00
    - Implement "display frequency".  You can set this frequency with a
      task, representing how often the task will display. For instance, to
      a task every 3 days, set to "3".  The start day is based on the task-id,
      so it is essentially random.

      now.
