NAME
====

`task.pl6` - Perl 6 task management application

SYNOPSIS
========

    task.pl6 new          # Add a new task
    task.pl6 list         # List existing tasks
    task.pl6 <num>        # Show information about a task
    task.pl6 note <num>   # Add notes to a task
    task.pl6 close <num>  # Close a task

DESCRIPTION
===========

This program provides basic to-do list management. The project was initially created by its author, Joelle Maslak, to solve her particular task tracking needs. However, it's likely to be useful to others as well.

CAVEATS
=======

This is not yet production-ready code. It runs, and I believe the bugs are reasonably managable, and it meets the author's current needs. However, it was never written with the intent of meeting anyone else's needs!

This code highly depends upon a terminal capable of interepreting the Xterminal color codes.

Editing notes requires the `nano` editor to be installed. The `less` pager is also used.

The author has not yet documented the main classes used by this program.

That said, suggestions are more then welcome!

GOALS / PHILOSOPHY
==================

The goals for this project, which may be changed by the author when she realizes they get in the way of something more important, are:

  * Maintain data in plain-text format

  * Each task is represented by a unique file

  * Simplicity for basic tasks

  * Somewhat scriptable front-end

  * Work inside a Unix shell account

  * Track pending work on a task (notes)

YOU'RE STILL HERE!
==================

Congrats! Now for the usage!

USAGE
=====

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

### `%ENV<TASKDIR>`

This enviornmental variable determines where the task database (files) reside. Open tasks are in this directory, while closed tasks are moved to the `done/` directory under this directory.

The default, if the environmental variable is not set, is `%ENV<HOME>/.task` if the `HOME` environmental variable is set. If the `HOME` environmental variable is not set, it it will be `.task` under the user's current working directory.

COMMANDS
--------

### No command line options

    task.pl

When `task.pl` is executed without any options, it enters an interactive mode. The author rarely uses this mode, preerring command line options instead.

### new

    task.pl new
    task.pl new <title>
    task.pl --expire-today new
    task.pl --expire-today new <title>

Create a new task. If a title is passed on the command line (as a single argument, so quotes may be needed if you have a multi-word title), it is simply created with an empty body.

If a title is not provided, an interactive dialog with the user asks for the title, and, optionally a more detailed set of notes.

If the `--expire-today` option is provided, the new task will have an expiration date of today. See [#expire](#expire) for more details.

### list

    task.pl list
    task.pl list <max-items>
    task.pl --show-immature list
    task.pl --show-immature list <max-items>

Display a list of active tasks. Normally, only non-immature tasks are shown. If the `--show-immature` option is provided, immature tasks are also shown.

Optionally, an integer specifying the maximum number of items to display can be provided.

### show

    task.pl <task-number>
    task.pl show <task-number>

Display a task's details. This uses the `less` pager if needed. All notes will be displayed with the task.

### monitor

    task.pl monitor
    task.pl --show-immature monitor

Displays an updating list of tasks that auto-refreshes. It displays as many tasks as will fit on the screen.

### note

    task.pl note <task-number>

Adds a note to a task. The note is appended to the task. Notes are visible via the [#show](#show) command.

You must have done a [#list](#list) in the current window before you can make notes, in case the task numbers have changed.

### close

    task.pl close <task-number>

Closes a task (moves it from the 

You must have done a [#list](#list) in the current window before you can make notes, in case the task numbers have changed.

This will automatically execute a `#coalesce`. Thus task numbers will change after using this.

You must have done a [#list](#list) in the current window before you can make notes, in case the task numbers have changed.

### retitle

    task.pl retitle <task-number>

Change the title on a task.

You must have done a [#list](#list) in the current window before you can make notes, in case the task numbers have changed.

### move

    task.pl move <task-number> <new-number>

Moves a task from it's current position to a new position (as seen by the list command).

This will automatically execute a `#coalesce`. Thus task numbers will change after using this.

You must have done a [#list](#list) in the current window before you can make notes, in case the task numbers have changed.

### set-expire

    task.pl set-expire <task-number>

Set an expiration date. This is the last day that the task is considered valid. This is used for tasks that don't make sense after a given date. For instance, if you add a task to buy a Christmas turkey, if you don't actually do that task before Christmas, it's likely not relevant after Christmas. Thus, you might set an expiration date of December 25th. At that point, it will be pruned by the [#expire](#expire) command.

You must have done a [#list](#list) in the current window before you can make notes, in case the task numbers have changed.

### expire

    task.pl expire

This closes any open tasks with an expiration date prior to the current date. It is suitable to run via crontab daily.

This will automatically execute a `#coalesce`. Thus task numbers will change after using this.

You must have done a [#list](#list) in the current window before you can make notes, in case the task numbers have changed.

### set-maturity

    task.pl set-maturity <task-number>

Sets the maturity date. Before the maturity date, a task will not be displayed with the [#list](#list) or [#monitor](#monitor) commands before the maturity date (unless the `--show-immature` option is also provided to the [#list](#list) or [#monitor](#monitor) commands).

### coalesce

    task.pl coalesce

Coalesces task numbers, so that the first task becomes task number 1, and any gaps are filled in, moving tasks as required. This is needed if tasks are deleted outside of the `task.pl6` program.

This will automatically execute a `#coalesce`. Thus task numbers will change after using this.

You must have done a [#list](#list) in the current window before you can make notes, in case the task numbers have changed.

OPTIONS
-------

### --expire-today

This option is used along with the [#new](#new) command to create a task that will expire today (see the [#expire](#expire) option for more details).

### --show-immature

Show all open tasks. Normally, tasks that are "immature" (see the L#<set-maturity> command) are not displayed by the [#monitor](#monitor) or [#list](#list) commands. This option changes that behavior.
